# Cartography Design Practices
This repository contains the maps for the projects in the Cartography course I took in 2021. For all the maps in this repository, the data sources are listed on the map. We utilized the open data to create the maps we created as exercises to implement the design concept and to practice several different tools or software at the same time.<br>
Throughout the course, I gained a solid understanding of cartography design principles and conventions. Additionally, I acquired proficiency in utilizing ArcGIS Pro for data editing, label incorporation, and exporting files for use with other design tools like Adobe Illustrator. When it came to designing and creating maps, we leveraged either ArcGIS Pro or a combination of ArcGIS Pro and extensive editing in Adobe Illustrator. This course effectively equipped me with the skills to utilize various tools, encompassing GIS technology as well as artistic design tools.<br>

## The purpose of each map
### Taiwan Public Transportation Infrastructure Map
This map is the final project I did in the course. It integrates all the knowledge and concepts I learned through the semester, and it is more curated than other maps for the lab assignments.

### Africa Map
This map is used as a practice for us to deal with enormous symbols and labels. The goal of this task is to show reasonable clarity and style of design.
